apis:
- name: Square Connect API Post V2 Customers Customer Cards
  description: |-
    Adds a card on file to an existing customer. In the United States
    Square takes care of automatically updating any cards on file that might
    have expired since you first attached them to a customer.

    As with charges, calls to `CreateCustomerCard` are idempotent. Multiple
    calls with the same card nonce return the same card record that was created
    with the provided nonce during the _first_ call.
